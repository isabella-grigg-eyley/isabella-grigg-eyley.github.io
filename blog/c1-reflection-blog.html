                    I think one of the biggest differences I can tell between EDA/DBC and
                    traditional education systems is the flexibility to fit each student,
                    rather than a standardised system that only suits the median student.
                    It's also far more proactive- traditional education systems don't 
                    tend to encourage or have personal benefits to giving more and becoming
                    more engaged. So I think this idea of encouraging interactivity and using
                    it as an opportunity for personal growth that has to be earned, rather than 
                    given, is positive.

                <p>
                    I think engaging with this will be a personal challenge as we are so
                    trained to expect to be given knowledge and skills by ticking boxes
                    and I am no exception to that rule, but I think this is a good opportunity 
                    to break that mental habit and develop better skills to self-develop. 
                </p>

                    I wouldn't say I'm nervous to participate in this kind of learning environment,
                    but I can see that it might be difficult at first to change that kind of
                    expectation mindset, particularly coming from a university environment 
                    where it's very much do assignment, be given grade, etc. But I do think
                    I can get a lot from this course both in terms of hard and soft skills that
                    will benefit me in the long run- particularly given development is such a 
                    fast-paced and ever-changing field and having the flexibility to keep 
                    up with that is so important.
