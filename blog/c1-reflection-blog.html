    <p>
    I think one of the biggest differences I can tell between EDA/DBC and
    traditional education systems is the flexibility to fit each student,
    rather than a standardised system that only suits the median student.
    It's also far more proactive- traditional education systems don't 
    tend to encourage or have personal benefits to giving more and becoming
    more engaged. So I think this idea of encouraging interactivity and using
    it as an opportunity for personal growth that has to be earned, rather than 
    given, is positive.

    I think engaging with this will be a personal challenge as we are so
    trained to expect to be given knowledge and skills by ticking boxes
    and I am no exception to that rule, but I think this is a good opportunity 
    to break that mental habit and develop better skills to self-develop.

    I wouldn't say I'm nervous to participate in this kind of learning environment,
    but I can see that it might be difficult at first to change that kind of
    expectation mindset, particularly coming from a university environment 
    where it's very much do assignment, be given grade, etc. But I do think
    I can get a lot from this course both in terms of hard and soft skills that
    will benefit me in the long run- particularly given development is such a 
    fast-paced and ever-changing field and having the flexibility to keep 
    up with that is so important.
