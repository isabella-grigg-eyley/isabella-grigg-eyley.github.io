                <h4>Cultural Blog, Sprint 3: Process over Product and Meditation</h4>
            </header>
            <div>
                <h5>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h5>
                <p>
                    To be honest... After a while I completely forgot about this. I do in general like to make sure code 
                    is structed correctly so that was always an element of it, but I did get carried away in perfectionism 
                    trying to make individual elements look and act the way I wanted them to. I will bear this in mind in the 
                    future though.
                </p>
                <h5> What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</h5>
                <p>
                    I think it's a common misconception to associate meditation with new age hippies, pseudoscience, etc, so 
                    I've found it interesting to have that perception debunked. I've also used it before to calm down or 
                    go to sleep but I didn't know it had such scientifically evidenced benefits in general.
                </p>
                <h5>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h5>
                <p>
                    Primarily I had no idea that mindfulness meditation can improve attention- given I've mentioned my ADHD 
                    before the benefits from that are obvious and I'm looking forward to seeing that improve! (I also really 
                    like the fact that it views getting distracted as an inevitable opportunity for growth, rather than 
                    something to reprimand yourself over, which is a positive thing to carry across to all work.)
                </p>
                <h5>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h5>
                <p>
                    I personally prefer the "easy way" of focussing on breathing- I'm used to doing that already. It also 
                    means I can listen to soothing music while meditating (I have tinnitus that distracts me endlessly if 
                    I don't have sound of some kind), and can focus on aligning my breathing with the music. 
                </p>
                <h5>Any other musings?</h5>
                <p>
                    Obviously this is a part of this course and I could view it as a course requirement, but I honestly 
                    think this is something that will really help me in the long term in multiple areas and I'm 
                    really glad it's been included in the course curriculum!
