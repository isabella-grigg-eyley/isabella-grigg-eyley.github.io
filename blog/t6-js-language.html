                <h5>In the JavaScript language, describe all the use cases for each of:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Parentheses</li>
                    <li>Brackets</li>
                    <li>Braces</li>
                    <li>Single quotes</li>
                    <li>Double quotes</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <b>Parentheses:</b> Parentheses have many uses. One is to simply group a 
                    collection of operators and statements- for example, x * 1 + 2 is different to 
                    x * (1 + 2). It's also used as a way to pass information to functions, inbuilt and 
                    custom written. For example, <i>if</i> statements require something that outputs to 
                    a value of <i> true</i> in order to continue, and these "somethings" are contained 
                    in parentheses. Another example is if a function is written needing values: these 
                    values are passed in inside parentheses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Brackets:</b> Brackets are used to access information inside objects or arrays. 
                    For example, writing myArray[3] will return the value at index 3 (so the fourth value 
                    stored in the array). It's also one of two methods to access information inside an object 
                    (the other being dot notation, or myObject.theValueIWant)- it's particularly useful if the 
                    key name of that value is a string with spaces, as that won't work with dot notation. So the 
                    syntax there would be myObject["The Value I Want"].
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Braces:</b> Braces contain blocks of code and are essentially wrappers to indicate to 
                    both the reader and the compiler where a series of code statements end. Without these 
                    code would be much harder to read and ambiguous.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Single and double quotes:</b> In Javascript, unlike other languages, both single and 
                    double quotes have the same meaning: they indicate the content within refers to a string. 
                    (In other languages, single quotes refer to character type content.)
