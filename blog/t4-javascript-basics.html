                <h5>How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</h5>
                <p>
                    HTML dictates the content and structure of a website, while CSS controls the 
                    visual style of the page and elements. JavaScript dictates the interactivity 
                    of a website and can be described as the difference between making a website 
                    and a web app.
                </p>
                <h5>
                    Explain control flow and loops using an example process from 
                    everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Control loops are making decisions based on different inputs. For example, 
                    deciding what clothes to wear based on the occasion. If the occasion is formal, 
                    wear a suit; if it's the beach, wear a swimsuit; otherwise, default to 
                    casual clothes. Loops involve repeating something until a condition is no longer 
                    met. For example, if you are not at your destination, take a step; you will 
                    continue to take steps infinitely until you are at your destination.
                </p>
                <h5>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h5>
                <p>
                    A variable can be thought of as a box containing something- a word, a number, 
                    anything. An array is a variable that contains multiple things- maybe it has both 
                    a number and a word in it. These things are ordered in rows- in this case, you 
                    would have the number first, then the word. To take an object out, you would ask 
                    for something at position 1, 2, etc (ignoring the fact indexes actually start at 0). 
                    An object is something else that has a variety of properties- maybe that a car has 
                    a colour, a number of wheels, a type of engine, is manual or automatic. In this case, 
                    instead of an index you ask what the value of a property is (key-value pairs, like a 
                    dictionary).
                </p>
                <h5>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h5>
                <p>
                    Functions are blocks of code that execute a series of actions. They can also return 
                    information. For example, instead of adding a series of numbers together manually, 
                    you could write a function that does it for you automatically and all you 
                    need to do is give it the numbers each time. This saves time and is more efficient.
