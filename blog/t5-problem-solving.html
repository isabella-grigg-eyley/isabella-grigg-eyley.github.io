                <h5>What was the problem?</h5>
                <p>
                    In a project I had prior to starting Dev Academy, I was working 
                    on C# in Unity. I was writing a script that was given a paragraph, 
                    parsed it, then took information from it (how many words in total, 
                    how many vowels in each word, what vowels were in each word), with 
                    the intent of then using that information to spawn objects in Unity 
                    and modify their characteristics using that information. However, for a 
                    while I had a problem where it was miscounting the number of vowels 
                    only for certain words, but working perfectly for most.
                </p>
                <h5>What problem solving techniques did you use?</h5>
                <p>
                    I'd written the intial program structure with pseudocode already, 
                    so that didn't help. There were also no error messages, as my syntax 
                    was technically correct- this meant my code was executing correctly, 
                    I'd just given it the wrong instruction somewhere. I used console 
                    logging to print each word and the amount of vowels it had in series: 
                    this helped me notice that it was only occuring in words where there 
                    were multiple of the same vowel, meaning (with the help of a programmer
                    friend) we were able to locate the incorrect logic parsing each word and 
                    fix it.
                </p>
                <h5>How did you feel throughout the process?</h5>
                <p>
                    Honestly, problem solving in programming can often just feel frustrating, 
                    but every time you do you learn for the future. And when you finally figure 
                    it out, it's such a relief. (Unless you realise you just misspelled a word 
                    and it took you three days of obsessing over the problem to notice. Then 
                    it's just aggravating!)
                </p>
                <h5>What did you learn?</h5>
                <p>
                    Log everything to console. Print off everything the code is doing. Also, 
                    make sure it prints in sentences that make sense- just rattling off 
                    a bunch of numbers isn't helpful if you can't immediate tell what number is 
                    what! I think this is honestly the most effective way to debug. Following that, 
                    rubber ducky, Google, then if you're out of ideas, ask someone else to read 
                    your code. They might just point out you forgot a semicolon at the end of 
                    your statement.
                </p>
                <h5>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:</h5>

                <p>
                    I generally start all programs that aren't immediately simple to 
                    write with pseudocode. This is useful in terms of working 
                    out the logic you need to write, as well as debugging and for 
                    reading the code later. I think I need to get in the habit of using 
                    the rubber ducky method more often: I actually have a designated 
                    programming-buddy plushy already (Toad from Mario!), but I never find 
                    myself actually doing that technique. As mentioned prior, I think reading 
                    error messages, printing to console and Google are the best fallbacks 
                    otherwise, but if I'm really stuck I will ask others. Generally I try to 
                    avoid that though, as people can get annoyed if you do that endlessly 
                    and often it's something you can work out yourself eventually.
