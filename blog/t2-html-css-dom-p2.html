            <h4>What is grid based design?</h4>
            <p>
                Grid based design is about structuring webpage elements in the form of rows and columns. 
                These row and column classes have set height/widths, so each class can be applied to the correct column 
                within a row to create consistent heights across variable widths. The example given was dividing the 
                page into 12 columns, allowing the coder to have elements with widths of any factor of 12 
                (1/12<sup>th</sup>, 2/12<sup>th</sup>s, 3/12<sup>th</sup>s, etc). This makes webpage design 
                and creation easier and more efficient.

            <h4>What's all the hype about responsive webpages?</h4>
            <p>
                Responsive webpages mean you can optimise design across screen sizes and orientations without having 
                static pixel-definition measurements of individual elements.
            </p>
            <h4>What is semantic structure?</h4>
            <p>
                Semantic structure is HTML structure tags that provide meaning to both the browser parsing the code and 
                people reading it. For example, article tags tell both the browser and coder that the content 
                within the tag is independent and self-contained, like a blog post or newspaper article. 
            </p>
            <h4>Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on?</h4>
            <p>
                Mostly that as I go along I realise how terrible my current HTML/CSS is and I suspect this 
                website will be subject to a lot of fixing of my original HTML and CSS...
