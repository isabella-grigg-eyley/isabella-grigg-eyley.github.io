                <h5>When programming, what are some of your triggers? What causes a disproportionate emotional response?</h5>
                <p>
                    I find it frustrating mostly when something doesn't work the way I expect it to and isn't easily 
                    debugged. Mostly this occurs when my logic is wrong, or when the syntax doesn't work in this instance 
                    the way I thought it would. The longer I spend debugging stubborn problems, the more frustrated 
                    I tend to get.

                <h5>How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)?</h5>
                <p>
                    I found it useful and again, I'm interested to see how I can implement it in life in general. I think 
                    it will be quite effective. It was also interesting the sample given of how acceptance of emotions 
                    can resolve more serious problems like panic or anxiety, as I have a specific phobia that has improved 
                    over the years but still is an ongoing issue. I plan to try this next time it's triggered.
