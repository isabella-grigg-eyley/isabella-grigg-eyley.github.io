                                    &bull; Text formatting- overall design has fun campy 50's sci-fi 
                                    vibe while still feeling modern. Probably individual elements 
                                    with clean simple background- minimal clutter. <br>
                                    &bull; Note: Not very responsive. Also has loading 
                                    screens- I found myself exiting the page in impatience. 
                                    Responsiveness > fancy JS elements!

            <div class="subtitle"><h2>Technical Blog, Part 1: Udacity Reflection</h2></div>
            <div>
                <h5>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</h5>
                <p>
                    HTML, CSS and the DOM can be compared to a book. The HTML contains the actual content of the book: the title, the story, chapter divisions, etc. CSS then is the formatting of the book: will it be hardcover or paperback? What does the cover look like and what font and size is the text in it? The DOM is the final book after publishing: the printing company has taken the guides for content and style and have created a document to show how they will actually print it. They also might adjust any errors or oversights in the original HTML/CSS if it's imperfect to meet their printing standards.
                </p>
                <h5>What is meant by boxifying design?</h5>
                <p>
                    Every element in an HTML page is contained in a rectangular box of some kind. This means that all items on a page can be divided into boxes, from header and body all the way down until you've boxed off every element. Elements in the same box can be grouped with a "div" tag. It also makes designing HTML based on a designer's page mockup easier as a process.
                </p>
                <h5>What is the box model?</h5>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        Each of these boxed elements is wrapped in a series of rectangles. First you have the core content, being the element itself. Around that you have the padding which is the space between content and border, then you have the border which can be transparent or not. Finally you have the margin, which is the space between boxed elements.
                    </p>
