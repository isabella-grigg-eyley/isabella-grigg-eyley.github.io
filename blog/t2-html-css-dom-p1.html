                                &bull; Text formatting- overall design has fun campy 50's sci-fi 
                                vibe while still feeling modern. Probably individual elements 
                                with clean simple background- minimal clutter. <br>
                                &bull; Note: Not very responsive. Also has loading 
                                screens- I found myself exiting the page in impatience. 
                                Responsiveness > fancy JS elements!

                <h4>Technical Blog 1: Udacity Reflection</h4>

                <h5>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? 
                    How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</h5>
                <p>
                    HTML, CSS and the DOM can be compared to a book. The HTML contains the actual 
                    content of the book: the title, the story, chapter divisions, etc. CSS 
                    then is the formatting of the book: will it be hardcover or paperback? 
                    What does the cover look like and what font and size is the text in 
                    it? The DOM is the final book after publishing: the printing company 
                    has taken the guides for content and style and have created a document 
                    to show how they will actually print it. They also might adjust any 
                    errors or oversights in the original HTML/CSS if it's imperfect to 
                    meet their printing standards.
                </p>
                <h5>What is meant by boxifying design?</h5>
                <p>
                    Every element in an HTML page is contained in a rectangular box of 
                    some kind. This means that all items on a page can be divided into 
                    boxes, from header and body all the way down until you've boxed off 
                    every element. Elements in the same box can be grouped with a "div" 
                    tag. It also makes designing HTML based on a designer's page mockup 
                    easier as a process.
                </p>
                <h5>What is the box model?</h5>
                <p>
                    Each of these boxed elements is wrapped in a series of rectangles. 
                    First you have the core content, being the element itself. Around that 
                    you have the padding which is the space between content and border, 
                    then you have the border which can be transparent or not. Finally 
                    you have the margin, which is the space between boxed elements.
