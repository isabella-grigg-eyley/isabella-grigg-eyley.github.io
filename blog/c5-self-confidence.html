                <h5>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h5>
                <p>
                    They are very similar concepts. Both have definitions from specialists in each 
                    area that are very similar in description, and we already know that mindfulness 
                    can be trained, meaning self-awareness can also be trained. Mindfulness also 
                    leads to self-awareness: mindfulness leads to being conscious of one's emotions, 
                    which is part one of being self-aware. 
                </p>
                <h5>
                    Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter 
                    (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?
                </h5>
                <p>
                    I did the body scan practice. He says afterwards that the body scan exercise tends 
                    to conduce sleep- which was definitely my biggest takeaway! I actually ended it a 
                    couple minutes earlier than I was meant to, just because I was so close to falling 
                    asleep. I will try it again though the next time I do a formal meditation practice 
                    (when I'm not already tired!). I did notice some tension I wasn't aware of previously, 
                    as well as how that changed slightly when I thought of a positive emotionally charged 
                    memory. 
                </p>
                <h5>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</h5>
                <p>
                    I really like the concept and think it can be helpful to frame emotions as a separate 
                    thing we can observe and react to of our own rational choosing, rather than being 
                    controlled by directly. I will try to bear this in mind in future.
