                <h5>
                    What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? 
                    How did the other person find it?
                </h5>
                <p>
                    The problem I have with this exercise is that I haven't seen anyone recently 
                    that I think would be open to trying it. That being said, I've been conscious of 
                    being mindful when people are listening and giving what they're saying my full 
                    attention, which isn't the exercise exactly but incorporates an element of it.
                </p>
                <h5>
                    Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Primarily the third (one breath a day), but also the second (do less than you can). I think 
                    becoming frustrated or bored with it is definitely something that could put me off in the 
                    long run if I'm not careful, which the "do less than you can" method avoids. One breath 
                    a day also means I can practice it for a short while whenever I remember to, almost regardless 
                    of what I'm doing.
                </p>
                <h5>
                    Any other musings?
                </h5>
                <p>
                    When I was doing the final exercise from the chapter, I noticed I find open meditation much 
                    easier to maintain as I don't have to constantly try to rein in distractions and can embrace 
                    that so long as I'm mindful of them and pay attention to them fully. I found myself struggling 
                    with the focused meditation section- ironically, usually because I was distracted by the thought 
                    that I needed to stay focused on breathing!
