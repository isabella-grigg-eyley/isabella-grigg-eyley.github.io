          I think of all the time and habit management techniques,
          I found the Fogg method the most useful immediately and
          the most likely to work for me personally. I think attempting
          to start big behaviours or projects is something I'm guilty
          of and I'm going to try this out- starting with tiny, achievable
          changes triggered by things I already do.
          </p>
          <p>
          That could then lead into getting into the habit of meditating,
          but realistically I think I'll need to practice the first
          technique in order to get into a habit of meditation. 
          </p>

          The Fogg method is probably going to be useful for me particularly
          as my ADHD makes getting started and staying on track for certain
          tasks harder than for neurotypical people, and I think it'll
          counter those issues well. It also helps with the internal guilt
          of not immediately being where you want to be (whether that's doing
          a certain amount of work per day or whatever other habit) and keeping
          track of my progress with that and slowly incrementing will be
          very helpful- moreso than attempting to immediately meet those goals
          then failing and feeling guilty.

          I've tried the Pomodoro technique in the past and I've found that
          it's not ideal for me personally- as mentioned, ADHD can make getting
          started on tasks difficult, and being interrupted and forced to stop
          working when I've only just gotten myself engaged with my work tends
          to make me far less, rather than more productive!
          </p>

          <p>
          Interestingly I think I've already gotten in the habit of timeboxing
          without knowing it was a thing- generally I plan to work until a 
          certain time, rather than setting goals based on how much work I get
          done, and I find it's more productive for me.
