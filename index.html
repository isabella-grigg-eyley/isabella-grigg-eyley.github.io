                    <h5>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h5>
                    <p>
                        To be honest... After a while I completely forgot about this. I do in general like to make sure code 
                        is structed correctly so that was always an element of it, but I did get carried away in perfectionism 
                        trying to make individual elements look and act the way I wanted them to. I will bear this in mind in the 
                        future though.
                    </p>
                    <h5> What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</h5>
                    <p>
                        I think it's a common misconception to associate meditation with new age hippies, pseudoscience, etc, so 
                        I've found it interesting to have that perception debunked. I've also used it before to calm down or 
                        go to sleep but I didn't know it had such scientifically evidenced benefits in general.
                    </p>
                    <h5>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h5>
                    <p>
                        Primarily I had no idea that mindfulness meditation can improve attention- given I've mentioned my ADHD 
                        before the benefits from that are obvious and I'm looking forward to seeing that improve! (I also really 
                        like the fact that it views getting distracted as an inevitable opportunity for growth, rather than 
                        something to reprimand yourself over, which is a positive thing to carry across to all work.)
                    </p>
                    <h5>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h5>
                    <p>
                        I personally prefer the "easy way" of focussing on breathing- I'm used to doing that already. It also 
                        means I can listen to soothing music while meditating (I have tinnitus that distracts me endlessly if 
                        I don't have sound of some kind), and can focus on aligning my breathing with the music. 
                    </p>
                    <h5>Any other musings?</h5>
                    <p>
                        Obviously this is a part of this course and I could view it as a course requirement, but I honestly 
                        think this is something that will really help me in the long term in multiple areas and I'm 
                        really glad it's been included in the course curriculum!

                    <h4 class="nine columns">Technical Blog 3: Responsive Frameworks and Mobile-First Design</h4>
                    <h5 class="three columns date"><small>16 July, 2018</small></h5>

                <h5>What is a responsive site, and why is responsiveness important?</h5>
                <p>
                    A responsive site is one that scales and adjusts itself depending on the size 
                    and type of screen being used to view it. This is important as users view websites 
                    on many different kinds of devices, ranging from mobile to desktop monitors, so 
                    websites need to work on each kind of screen without breaking or becoming 
                    difficult to use.
                </p>
                <h5>What is mobile-first design, and why is it important?</h5>
                <p>
                    Mobile-first design is the idea of building your website for mobile scale first 
                    then expanding out to desktop. It also means that your CSS should default to mobile 
                    scaling and format, and only when exceeding a certain size go back to desktop proportions. 
                    It's important because it makes developing a website that works for all sizes of platforms 
                    much easier: it's easier to make content bigger than to attempt to squish it down 
                    to mobile size. It also means you're not likely to accidentally have content/HTML/CSS 
                    that does not work for mobile.
                </p>
                <h5>What are frameworks? What are their pros and cons?</h5>
                <p>
                    Frameworks are pre-built CSS rulesets and building structures that make developing websites 
                    simpler. The general pro is that is expedites the process of website development. However 
                    as it hides some aspect of how the website works from the developers, it can hinder learning.
                </p>
                <h5>What is a wireframe and why do we use them?</h5>
                <p>
                    Wireframes are a technique used by website designers to work out the layout of content on 
                    a page without being distracted by design details or colour. They also are an effective 
                    reference point to develop from for the actual coders, and are a good way to convey website 
                    design to clients without them getting distracted by other elements.
                </p>

                    <div class="wireframes">

                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <h5>What aspect of your wireframes did you find difficult to implement? Why?</h5>
                            <p>
                                I found the header bar quite tricky, particularly getting the menu elements to sit correctly 
                                in it. I will revisit it when I understand CSS a little better and polish it a bit! There were 
                                also other elements I had planned that I realised later I couldn't implement without Javascript 
                                (i.e. the hamburger-icon dropdown menu for mobile). Again, when I've worked on Javascript I will 
                                add that in. (Also, honestly, getting these pictures to sit right took 40 minutes 
                                and drove me mental!)
