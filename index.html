                <h5>How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</h5>
                <p>
                    HTML dictates the content and structure of a website, while CSS controls the 
                    visual style of the page and elements. JavaScript dictates the interactivity 
                    of a website and can be described as the difference between making a website 
                    and a web app.
                </p>
                <h5>
                    Explain control flow and loops using an example process from 
                    everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Control loops are making decisions based on different inputs. For example, 
                    deciding what clothes to wear based on the occasion. If the occasion is formal, 
                    wear a suit; if it's the beach, wear a swimsuit; otherwise, default to 
                    casual clothes. Loops involve repeating something until a condition is no longer 
                    met. For example, if you are not at your destination, take a step; you will 
                    continue to take steps infinitely until you are at your destination.
                </p>
                <h5>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h5>
                <p>
                    A variable can be thought of as a box containing something- a word, a number, 
                    anything. An array is a variable that contains multiple things- maybe it has both 
                    a number and a word in it. These things are ordered in rows- in this case, you 
                    would have the number first, then the word. To take an object out, you would ask 
                    for something at position 1, 2, etc (ignoring the fact indexes actually start at 0). 
                    An object is something else that has a variety of properties- maybe that a car has 
                    a colour, a number of wheels, a type of engine, is manual or automatic. In this case, 
                    instead of an index you ask what the value of a property is (key-value pairs, like a 
                    dictionary).
                </p>
                <h5>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h5>
                <p>
                    Functions are blocks of code that execute a series of actions. They can also return 
                    information. For example, instead of adding a series of numbers together manually, 
                    you could write a function that does it for you automatically and all you 
                    need to do is give it the numbers each time. This saves time and is more efficient.

                    <h5 class="three columns date"><small>18 July, 2018</small></h5>

                <h5>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h5>
                <p>
                    To be honest... After a while I completely forgot about this. I do in general like to make sure code 
                    is structed correctly so that was always an element of it, but I did get carried away in perfectionism 
                    trying to make individual elements look and act the way I wanted them to. I will bear this in mind in the 
                    future though.
                </p>
                <h5> What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</h5>
                <p>
                    I think it's a common misconception to associate meditation with new age hippies, pseudoscience, etc, so 
                    I've found it interesting to have that perception debunked. I've also used it before to calm down or 
                    go to sleep but I didn't know it had such scientifically evidenced benefits in general.
                </p>
                <h5>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h5>
                <p>
                    Primarily I had no idea that mindfulness meditation can improve attention- given I've mentioned my ADHD 
                    before the benefits from that are obvious and I'm looking forward to seeing that improve! (I also really 
                    like the fact that it views getting distracted as an inevitable opportunity for growth, rather than 
                    something to reprimand yourself over, which is a positive thing to carry across to all work.)
                </p>
                <h5>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h5>
                <p>
                    I personally prefer the "easy way" of focussing on breathing- I'm used to doing that already. It also 
                    means I can listen to soothing music while meditating (I have tinnitus that distracts me endlessly if 
                    I don't have sound of some kind), and can focus on aligning my breathing with the music. 
                </p>
                <h5>Any other musings?</h5>
                <p>
                    Obviously this is a part of this course and I could view it as a course requirement, but I honestly 
                    think this is something that will really help me in the long term in multiple areas and I'm 
                    really glad it's been included in the course curriculum!
