                <h4>Cultural Blog 3: Emotional Intelligence</h4>
            </header>
            <div>
                <h5>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h5>
                <p>
                    There were several topics discussed. Firstly that emotional intelligence can be divided into 5 main aspects:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Self-awareness</li>
                        <li>Self-regulation</li>
                        <li>Motivation</li>
                        <li>Empathy</li>
                        <li>Social skills</li>
                    </ol>

                    These aspects can further be grouped as to whether they relate to intrapersonal or interpersonal skills. 
                    The first three are intrapersonal, while the last two are interpersonal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Emotional intelligence is a leading contributer to success 
                    professionally. A study mentioned found the top predictors of success in the tech sector were:
                    <br>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Strong achievement drive and high achievement standards</li>
                        <li>Ability to influence</li>
                        <li>Conceptual thinking</li>
                        <li>Analytical ability</li>
                        <li>Initiative in taking on challenges</li>
                        <li>Self-confidence</li>
                    </ol>

                    Of that list, 4 related to emotional intelligence and only 2 to intellectual intelligence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Emotional intelligence, on a personal level, creates the opportunity to actively create 
                    a default state of happiness. It also importantly helps to moderate emotions- as one is 
                    mindful of their own body, they can be conscious of what emotions are arising and when,
                    meaning it's easier to prevent them from spiralling. The author also mentions that 
                    labelling emotions helps to contain them. Learning these skills is possible due to 
                    neuroplasticity: that is, the ability of the brain to develop and change through 
                    conscious and repeated behaviours and associations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Training emotional intelligence starts with training attention. Having strong, calm and 
                    stable attention provides the base for emotional intelligence, and a calm, rational 
                    perspective with which to view emotional states from. It also allows a pause between 
                    and emotional trigger and reacting to it, so you can decide whether or not to react 
                    at all. The author suggests the best way to train attention is by practising mindful 
                    meditation for 2 minutes a day: sitting and simply being, and either focussing on your 
                    breathing or on nothing at all (allowing your mind to wander, or not).
                </p>

                <h5>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h5>
                <p>
                    I'm actually already fairly familiar with the concept, as mindful meditation is something 
                    I've tried before (and something I've learned to use as a tool while dealing with mental 
                    health in myself and others- it can help with anxiety when it's not too severe). 
                    It's also often how I get to sleep so I guess in that sense I already have a habit of it!

                <h5>What is grid based design?</h5>
                <p>
                    Grid based design is about structuring webpage elements in the form of rows and columns. 
                    These row and column classes have set height/widths, so each class can be applied to the correct column 
                    within a row to create consistent heights across variable widths. The example given was dividing the 
                    page into 12 columns, allowing the coder to have elements with widths of any factor of 12 
                    (1/12<sup>th</sup>, 2/12<sup>th</sup>s, 3/12<sup>th</sup>s, etc). This makes webpage design 
                    and creation easier and more efficient.
                </p>
                <h5>What's all the hype about responsive webpages?</h5>
                <p>
                    Responsive webpages mean you can optimise design across screen sizes and orientations without having 
                    static pixel-definition measurements of individual elements.
                </p>
                <h5>What is semantic structure?</h5>
                <p>
                    Semantic structure is HTML structure tags that provide meaning to both the browser parsing the code and 
                    people reading it. For example, article tags tell both the browser and coder that the content 
                    within the tag is independent and self-contained, like a blog post or newspaper article. 
                </p>
                <h5>Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on?</h5>
                <p>
                    Mostly that as I go along I realise how terrible my current HTML/CSS is and I suspect this 
                    website will be subject to a lot of fixing of my original HTML and CSS...
